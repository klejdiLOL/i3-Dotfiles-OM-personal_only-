# i3 Dotfiles for the OM i3 Spin (MY CONTRIBUTION ONLY)

These are dotfiles for the i3 OM Community Spin. They're all configured to work on the specified directories, and any change in paths **!!WILL RESULT IN A BREAK!!**.

**Some files aren't fully modified from me, rather, just tested from me.**

## List of current dotfiles
- **i3** (i3-gaps) -> Shortcuts, Defaults, Gaps;
- **Kitty** -> Colors, Font, Transparency;
- **Picom** -> Transparency, Round Corners, Transition Fading;
- **Polybar** -> Modules, Colors, Themes, Organization of Modules, Scripts;
- **Conky** -> Position, Fonts, Colors, Information Displayed;
- **Rofi** -> Powermenu, App menu, Colors, Fonts, Position and size.

## Installation
Follow the guide on [HowToInstall.md](https://github.com/klejdiLOL/i3-Dotfiles-OM-personal_only-/blob/main/HowToInstall.md). Please don't forget that these configurations are made specifically to match OpenMandirva's prerequesties and schemes (in other words, they're branded with OpenMandriva's resources).

## Resources used so far:
### - Manjaro's i3 Conky configuration -> [GitHub Page](https://github.com/oberon-manjaro/conkies/blob/master/config_i3/conky_maia)
- Only used as a base, modified
### - adi1090x's Grayblocks Polybar configuration -> [GitHub Page](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes?tab=readme-ov-file#grayblocks)
- Only used as a base, heavily modified

## Additional Info
For developing and requirements reasons, all of the dotfiles are made to be put into the user's home folder, not a system-wide folder. For this reason, only key elements will be visible when logged through ``root`` account, and the system will look broken. The shortcuts will all work though.
